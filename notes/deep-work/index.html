		<h1>Deep Work</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Cal Newport&rsquo;s <em>Deep Work</em> discusses the increasing rarity and value in the ability to work deeply.</p>

<p>It has inspired me to reflect a bit on the role that mindfulness and distraction play in daily life.</p>

<p>At work, much of my contribution relies on my ability to share information with others or to participate in peer review. It seems as though it would be either difficult or hypocritical to focus on my efforts without participating in the distracting, ad-hoc nature of this work. I would rely on others to do the same ad-hoc work, so not participating in it myself seems wrong.</p>

<p>Because of this, I&rsquo;ve found it difficult to apply Newport&rsquo;s perspective to my professional work. I have tried to apply it to personal endeavors instead. It&rsquo;s become very apparent to me in the past few months that I accumulate books much, much faster than I read them. I&rsquo;ve resolved to read books at at least the same rate that I collect them, in an effort not only to enrich myself personally but to assuage some of my guilt.</p>

<p>When reading <em>Deep Work</em>, I often thought that splitting my attention between several deep pursuits in a small time frame seems harmless. What&rsquo;s the problem if I were to read a technical book like Martin Kleppmann&rsquo;s <em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em> while I wait for my code to build? I did not get the impression from <em>Deep Work</em> that there is anything wrong with this, but I&rsquo;m starting to have my doubts.</p>

<p>When I find myself waiting for something outside of work, I cycle through the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chess.com, to see if any games are awaiting my move.</li>
<li>Lichess, whose puzzles I prefer to Chess.com&rsquo;s.</li>
<li>Email, to see if I&rsquo;ve received anything interesting. (I most likely haven&rsquo;t.)</li>
<li>Apple Books, where I&rsquo;ve started reading some research texts that I&rsquo;ve found as PDFs.</li>
<li>Thinking about work or hobbies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these efforts do not require active engagement beyond a few minutes, or if they do, I often do not have more than a few minutes before I am no longer waiting.</p>

<p>I would imagine this goes against Newport&rsquo;s ideas. He mentions specifically that one should delete social media, and while I have deleted the social media that I used with any regularity from my phone, I feel as though the use of Chess.com isn&rsquo;t much better than a social media app. Is the use of email much better? Is the use of Apple Books, when I don&rsquo;t have the time to focus on the text at hand, much better? Perhaps I am failing to heed the advice to embrace boredom.</p>

<p>This desire to replace the downtime with something that could be construed as productive, like chess or a book, seems indicative of the kind of behavior Newport recommends against. That it seems productive or helpful is only an illusion I use to feel better about doing the same thing to which Newport attributes the decline of one&rsquo;s ability to focus.</p>

<p>In a lot of ways, the thin arguments I might use to justify this behavior seem very similar to the arguments Newport addresses from proponents of social media. They seem justified on face value, but are they as true as I might suggest? For example, when proponents claim Facebook allows users to stay connected to friends and family, Newport questions how earnest this connection really is. Though I might claim playing chess while queueing improves my ability to focus and consider my actions&rsquo; ramifications, how well is it doing that? Though I might imagine reading a book one page at a time, slowly, will get me through it eventually, would it be more beneficial to my ability to focus than just practicing mindfulness?</p>

<p>Beyond just the things I&rsquo;m in control of, what role does advertising play in the decline of focusing ability? Advertisements and &ldquo;clickbait&rdquo; are designed to catch a person&rsquo;s attention. Social media sites are designed to keep users in a state of distraction and malaise &ndash; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/research-finds-link-between-social-media-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/2013/07/08/b2cc7ddc-e287-11e2-a11e-c2ea876a8f30_story.html">fears of missing out</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180104-is-social-media-bad-for-you-the-evidence-and-the-unknowns">other maladies</a> permeate frequent users of these sites. They&rsquo;re designed to harm the user for the benefit of the creator (which creator?) and yet they&rsquo;re so pervasive, many people who use social media have a hard time recognizing the harm or imagining a life without them. Social media and the advertising industries &ndash; perhaps one and the same nowadays &ndash; have reached such critical mass as to be unavoidable in at least some way. (In fact, querying for research that social media inflicts harm on one&rsquo;s mental health yields many results that reek of clickbait themselves.)</p>

<p>Is the loss of focusing ability another result of these industries? When these systems are designed to be as addictive as possible, often exploiting psychological underpinnings we can&rsquo;t escape, are users at fault? Should we consider users responsible for harming their ability to focus, even if it has minor impact on those around them? When we lose our ability to focus (and keeping in the vein of <em>Deep Work</em>, our ability to craft quality works) do we lose something more deep, more human? If the end users aren&rsquo;t responsible for losing abilities like this, are companies like Facebook and Google responsible?</p>

<p><em>Deep Work</em> is an exciting text that I look forward to revisiting when I&rsquo;ve had some time to iterate on my strategy. Sold under the premise of career advancement or self-improvement, it should incite within everyone a similar reflection on the nature that attentiveness plays in all of our lives and what we owe to our neighbors. While I might have initially rejected some of the strategies Newport proposes, on the grounds that they are unrealistic for my lifestyle, I might stand corrected.</p>
