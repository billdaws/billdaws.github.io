		<h1>Deep Work</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Cal Newport&rsquo;s <em>Deep Work</em> discusses the increasing rarity and also value in the ability to work deeply.</p>

<p>It has inspired me to reflect a bit on the role that mindfulness and distraction play in daily life.</p>

<p>At work, much of my contribution relies on my ability to share information with others or to participate in peer review. It seems as though it would be either difficult or hypocritical to focus on my efforts without participating in the distracting, ad-hoc nature of this work. I would rely on others to do the same ad-hoc work, so not participating in it myself seems wrong.</p>

<p>Because of this, I&rsquo;ve found it difficult to apply Newport&rsquo;s perspective to my professional work. I have tried to apply it to personal endeavors instead. It&rsquo;s become very apparent to me in the past few months that I accumulate books much, much faster than I read them. I&rsquo;ve resolved to read books at at least the same rate that I collect them, in an effort not only to enrich myself personally but to assuage some of my guilt.</p>

<p>When reading <em>Deep Work</em>, I often thought that splitting my attention between several deep pursuits in a small time frame seems harmless. What&rsquo;s the problem if I were to read a technical book like Martin Kleppmann&rsquo;s <em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em> while I wait for my code to build? I did not get the impression from <em>Deep Work</em> that there is anything wrong with this, but I&rsquo;m starting to have my doubts.</p>

<p>When I find myself queueing, I cycle through the following:
* Chess.com, to see if any games are awaiting my move.
* Email, to see if I&rsquo;ve received anything interesting. (I most likely haven&rsquo;t.)
*</p>
